        <h3>Dance Uniform Decoration Rules</h3>
        <p>
            Because dance is mostly synchronized, it's especially important that the dance outfit give your team the
            uniform look. Whether your dance team is opting for today's athletic style with long pants and a midriff
            spandex top, or the more traditional skirt or shorts and "T" combo, the uniform reflects your team. The
            uniform says a lot, and what it says to your audience can be especially important in competitions where
            judges are watching for how seriously your team wants to win. So when you're designing or decorating your
            dance uniform, it's important to keep in mind color and style choices. And more importantly, what rules and
            regulations have to say. Remember that rules may vary from one school or organization to another, so be sure
            and know the rules that apply to your team.

                <li>
                    Garments must be "secure" to prevent "wardrobe malfunction" or clothing coming open or apart.
