            <h3>How It All Began</h3>
            <p>
                The Lindisfarne Ballroom Dancing Club (LBDC) is a non-profit social dancing club.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded all the way back in 1977 as the University of Regina Dance Club, the club's original mandate was to give dance lovers a venue to learn and practice and to provide a social outlet in which an interest in ballroom dancing could flourish into full-blown passion.  Of course, we have since gotten carried away. We are now open to the public - meaning that since 1983, the club has been attracting some of the most talented dancers in town.

            <h3>Dance Lessons</h3>
            <p>
                We teach a wide selection of dances and focus on the enjoyment of dancing rather than the competitive aspect. All adults are welcome: the young and the young in spirit, singles and couples, absolute beginners, those with two left feet, and the experts who need somewhere to show off.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each lesson is one hour long, and if you can’t get enough we offer three 15-minutes practice session each night. The perfect occasion to corner an instructor for some one-on-one attention.

            <h3>Our Dances</h3>
            <p>
                Two times a year we give in to the glitter and hold big dances. These are great dress-up occasions. LBDC also hosts social dances year-round. A great way to spend a Saturday night, these are also a relaxed occasion to keep dancing and practicing, and we welcome members and non-members.
